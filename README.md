### To run:
If you want to run using keyboard keys and play it by yourself, then please use the next command:
```terminal
python src/main.py
```
To run using random moves, please use:
```terminal
python src/main.py --algorithm=Random
```

### Results:
The project aimed to find an effective strategy for a mobile robot to collect cans using a combination of a heuristic function and a BFS algorithm. The robot's behaviour was guided by a reinforcement learning agent based on  its  battery  charge  level.  The  environment  was  modelled  as  a  finite  Markov  Decision  Process  (MDP)  with defined transition probabilities and expected rewards.
